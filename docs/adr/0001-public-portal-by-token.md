# ADR 0001: Public token-based provider portal for Work Orders

## Context
The rentED system needs to allow service providers to submit quotes and execution proofs without creating permanent user accounts.

Providers are known and recurring, but the initial goal is to keep the workflow simple, avoiding full onboarding, passwords, or traditional authentication, reducing friction and operational complexity.

At the same time, Work Orders contain sensitive information such as full property addresses and must be exposed in a controlled and temporary way.

## Decision
A public provider portal will be implemented using tokenized URLs in the format:



/p/wo/{token}


Each token:
- is generated by the backend
- has a defined action scope (quote submission, interest submission, or execution proof)
- has an expiration date
- can be revoked when the Work Order is closed or canceled

The portal enables:
- quote submission for quote-based Work Orders
- interest submission for fixed-offer Work Orders
- execution proof submission including Pix payment information

No permanent provider accounts are required.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1) Full provider account system
Rejected due to:
- high onboarding friction
- additional maintenance overhead
- unnecessary complexity for early-stage usage

### 2) WhatsApp authentication from the first version
Rejected due to:
- external dependency complexity
- additional infrastructure and compliance requirements
- not required for the MVP

### 3) Public links without token validation
Rejected due to:
- security risks
- lack of access control and revocation
- no auditability

## Consequences

### Positive
- Very low friction provider experience
- No external user management required
- Temporary and controllable access
- Clear upgrade path to stronger authentication in the future

### Negative
- Requires token lifecycle management
- Additional backend validation logic
- Not suitable alone for large-scale public exposure
